What is the project about?
Fetching info about what foodtrucks are parking at Solna Campus each week.
Why did you develop it, what was your motivation?
Knowing what I could have for lunch if I went there
What problem does it solve?
Knowing if its worth it planning for a food truck lunch
What have you learned?
That not all webpages are so well maintained. The program works, however the webpage seems to be uppdated occationally, which was a disappointment. But the project was a good learning.
The plan was to develop the program and make a discord bot for it - but with difficulty knowing if the data i accurate (since the publishing on the web page not is frequent) that has been put on ice.
What makes your project stand out?
Fetching data from images was rather fun.
